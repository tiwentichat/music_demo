1. **"Where are you from, and is this your first time visiting China?"**

Hi, my name is Thibaut, I'm 27 and I come from France. In 2017, I visited Beijing and really appreciated it. At that time, I told myself I would come back to work one day if I got the chance, and here I am!

2. **"What brings you to China, and what interests you the most?"**

I like Chinese culture, Chinese food, and the Chinese way of life. I also think the country is really nice and has a lot of places to visit, from mountains to seashores.

3. **"Can you share some cultural or travel experiences that have stood out to you in China?"**

As my Mandarin is not really good, I often have confusion or trouble when I communicate with people. For example, when I try to buy some food, they don't really understand and give me something I didn't ask for, or sometimes they have no idea what I am asking. Anyway, people will try to help me, repeat the question many times, and use their hands to show me! I also think people are really kind and welcoming, and if you show interest, they will be happy to help you or share a moment.

4. **"3 things in China that challenged you?"**

*  **Administrative part:** Even for work, it is quite difficult to have all the documents and pass the controls. Even when arriving in the country, you need to follow a lot of procedures (working card, police to declare your address, etc.) and it is difficult because of the language barrier.
*  **Food:** Here I had the chance to try a lot of food I didn't know, like durian, stinky tofu, and some fishes. It is anyway a nice surprise and part of the experience.
*  **Work:** The way people work here is quite different from what I used to know. At first, it can be a bit surprising and you need to adapt to new habits!

5. **"3 tips for other foreigners traveling in China?"**

*  Install Chinese applications before leaving and make sure they work (Alipay, WeChat, maps, translator) or it can be tricky and challenging.
*  Check hotels carefully because most of them refuse foreigners.
*  Learn some basic Mandarin!

6. **"3 reasons why foreigners should consider visiting China?"**

*  It is a nice country with a strong culture and welcoming people. The country has great landscapes, from tea fields to mountains.
*  The food is a real experience and as the country is very vast, you can have a lot of different experiences.
*  The country is not really well known and they might be surprised by what they will discover!
